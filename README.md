# mern

create a git repo with the Node gitignore, then:

`curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samjtro/mern/main/setup' > setup; chmod +x setup; ./setup`

## what does this do?

bootstraps a boilerplate node project using the mern stack - as minimal as possible. based on: [fullstackopen](fullstackopen.com/en)

read the setup script line by line for more info, you can add/delete lines as necessary before running.
