# mern

usage: `chmod +x setup; ./setup`

two notes:
- before doing this, create a git repo with the Node gitignore; then, move the setup file to your repo
- having `npm` installed is the only requirement

## what does this do?

bootstraps a boilerplate node project using the mern stack - as minimal as possible. based on: [fullstackopen](fullstackopen.com/en)

read the setup script line by line for more info, you can add/delete lines as necessary before running.
